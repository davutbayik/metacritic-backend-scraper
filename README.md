## ✨ What is this?

The **Metacritic Backend Scraper** is a Python tool that taps into Metacritic’s **unofficial public backend API** to pull detailed, structured data on:

- 🕹️ **Games**
- 🎥 **Movies**
- 📺 **TV Shows**

It uses clean `requests` logic with retry mechanisms, structured `Pydantic` models for data validation, and saves everything to organized **CSV files**. Ideal for data science, machine learning, or just geeking out on media insights.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Full metadata extraction (release date, ratings, genres, platforms, cast, director, etc.)  
✅ Fetch **critic and user reviews**, complete with scores and quotes  
✅ Supports **top-ranked titles**, **by year**, or **custom product lists**  
✅ Logs every action to both **console and file**  
✅ Saves outputs to easy-to-use CSVs  
✅ Unicode-safe, URL-safe slugification  
✅ Built with modularity, extensibility, and readability in mind
